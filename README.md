## 🌟 Features

### Core
* **💉 Universal Injection:** Works on **any** website. Automatically detects chat inputs in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, HuggingChat, and any generic text area or contenteditable field.
* **⚡️ High Performance:** Optimized injection engine with native setter hack for textareas and smart `innerText` fallback for large texts (2000+ chars), ensuring instant injection without freezing.
* **📚 Multi-Library Support:** Manage multiple independent libraries (e.g. *Personal*, *Work*, *Clients*) from a single dropdown in the header. Create, rename and delete libraries on the fly. Existing single-tree data is migrated automatically on first run.
* **↪️ Move Between Libraries:** Move any prompt or folder (with all its children) to another library from the context menu (⋮). The submenu expands inline so the main menu stays visible while you pick the destination.
* **📂 Unlimited Folders:** Organize your prompts in a nested folder structure without depth limits. Collapsible folders with visual open/closed icons.
* **🔍 Instant Search:** Real-time filtering by title **and** content to find any prompt instantly.
* **🖱️ Smart Drag & Drop:** Reorder prompts and folders freely with precise drop zones — insert before, after, or inside a folder — with visual guides.
* **💾 Local & Private:** All data is stored locally in your browser via `chrome.storage.local`. No external servers, no tracking, no accounts.

### Smart Variables
* **🧠 Dynamic Variables:** Use `{{VariableName}}` syntax to create reusable templates with dynamic inputs.
* **📋 Default Values:** Define defaults with the pipe syntax: `{{Role|Marketing Expert}}`. The field comes pre-filled with the default.
* **🕐 Variable History:** Remembers your last 5 inputs per variable as clickable chips for quick reuse.
* **🔙 Back Navigation:** Navigate forward and backward between variables when filling multi-variable prompts.
* **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts:** Press `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter`) to confirm, `Escape` to cancel.
* **📝 Large Text Area:** Resizable textarea input, perfect for pasting long articles or full context.

### Organization & Productivity
* **⭐ Favorites:** Mark any prompt or folder as a favorite. Favorites are visually highlighted with a star and automatically sorted to the top.
* **📋 Prompt Preview:** Click on any prompt to expand/collapse a content preview (first 200 characters) without opening the editor.
* **📑 Duplicate:** Clone any prompt or folder (including children) with a single click. The copy is placed right next to the original.
* **📊 Usage Tracking:** Each prompt tracks how many times it has been used (injected or copied) and when it was last used. A subtle badge and tooltip display the stats.
* **📝 Edit & Delete:** Inline editing for titles and content. Confirmation dialog before deleting.
* **📋 Copy to Clipboard:** One-click copy of any prompt content, with toast confirmation feedback.

### Backup & Sync
* **📦 Export:** Download your entire library as a JSON file, including prompts, folder structure, variable history, favorites, and usage stats.
* **📥 Import:** Restore from a backup file with full validation. Supports both the new format (`{prompts, variableHistory}`) and legacy format (plain array) for backward compatibility.
* **🕐 Last Modified Indicator:** Displays the timestamp of the last library change, useful for keeping track of sync status across browsers.

### Appearance & Localization
* **🌙 Dark Mode:** Full dark theme with a single toggle button. Covers all UI elements — tree, modals, chips, footer, drag & drop guides, and previews. Your preference persists across sessions.
* **🌍 Multi-Language UI:** Full interface translation in **Español**, **English** and **Català**. Auto-detected from your browser language on first run, switchable any time from the 🌐 button in the header, and persisted across sessions. Last-updated date is also formatted in the active locale.
* **✨ Visual Feedback:** Toast notifications for copy, duplicate, and favorite actions. Yellow flash animation on the target chat input when injecting a prompt.

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Opening the Library
Click the extension icon in your toolbar. This will open the **Side Panel** where your entire prompt library lives.

### 2. Managing Libraries
* **Switch:** Click the library name in the header to open the dropdown and switch between libraries.
* **Create:** From the same dropdown, click **➕ New library** and give it a name.
* **Rename / Delete:** Hover over a library in the dropdown and use the ✏️ / 🗑️ icons.
* **Move items between libraries:** Open the ⋮ menu of any prompt or folder and pick **"Move to library…"** — the destinations expand inline so you don't lose context.

### 3. Managing Prompts & Folders
* **Create:** Use the toolbar buttons to create a **New Folder** 📂 or a **New Prompt** 📝.
* **Edit:** Open the ⋮ context menu of any item and click **Edit** to modify title or content.
* **Delete:** From the same ⋮ menu, click **Delete** (with confirmation).
* **Duplicate:** From the ⋮ menu, click **Duplicate** to clone any item instantly.

### 4. Organizing with Drag & Drop
Drag items to reorder them:
* *Top of item:* Insert **before**.
* *Bottom of item:* Insert **after**.
* *Center of folder:* Move **inside** the folder.

### 5. Using Smart Variables
Create dynamic templates using double curly braces `{{...}}`. You can define **default values** using the pipe `|` symbol.

**Example Prompt:**
> "Act as a {{Role|Marketing Expert}} and write a blog post about {{Topic}}."

**When you inject this prompt:**
1. A modal will appear for each unique variable.
2. **History Chips:** Previously used values appear as clickable chips.
3. **Default Values:** Fields come pre-filled with their defaults (e.g., "Marketing Expert").
4. **Back Button:** Navigate back to previous variables if you need to change something.
5. **Large Input:** The input is a resizable text area, ideal for pasting long context.
6. **Keyboard:** `Ctrl + Enter` / `Cmd + Enter` to confirm · `Escape` to cancel.

### 6. Injection
Click the ➤ **send** button or use copy to clipboard. The extension automatically detects the active chat input on the current page and injects the final text with all variables replaced.

### 7. Backup & Restore
* **Export:** Click the 💾 save button to download a `.json` backup of the active library (prompts + variable history + library name).
* **Import:** Click the 📥 upload button and select a previously exported file. You'll be asked whether to import it as a **new library** (recommended) or to **replace** the current one.

### 8. Dark Mode & Language
* Click the 🌙 moon icon in the toolbar to toggle dark mode. Your preference is saved automatically.
* Click the 🌐 globe icon to switch the interface language between **Español**, **English** and **Català**. The choice is persisted across sessions.

## 🔧 Supported Chat Platforms

The injection engine detects inputs in this priority order:

1. `#prompt-textarea` — **ChatGPT**
2. `div[contenteditable="true"]` — **Claude**, **Gemini**
3. `textarea` — **Perplexity**, **HuggingChat**, and others
4. `input[type="text"]` — Generic fallback

If no chat input is found, the extension displays an error message asking the user to reload the page.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

* **Offline First:** This extension does not send any data to external servers. Your prompts live in your browser's local storage.
* **No Tracking:** No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party scripts.
* **Permissions:** The extension requires `host_permissions` solely to inject text into chat input fields on the active page. `storage` permission is used for local data persistence.
* **Import Validation:** Imported files are validated against a strict schema before being accepted, preventing malformed data from corrupting your library.
